- Hi, I’m @dialuplove
-  What I’m Interested In:
    Creative automation – finding ways to make tech solve human problems we usually take for granted.
    Cybersecurity & OSINT – because nothing beats the thrill of peeling back the layers.
    AI & ML – exploring the boundary between understanding and implementation, one GPU task at a time.
    Ethical hacking & self-hosted honeypots – turning Raspberry Pi into traps and treasure maps.
    Gamification & personal growth – building tools that trick people into understanding themselves and getting better on purpose.
    Making and tinkering – Raspberry Pi, Arduino, networking gear, whatever I can get my hands on.
-  I’m currently learning:
    Python 3.12
    miniConda
    LLMs
-  I’m looking to:
    Find my people!
