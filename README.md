## 👋 Hi, I’m @dialuplove

### 🔍 What I’m Into

- **Creative automation** – making tech solve everyday human problems we take for granted.  
- **Cybersecurity & OSINT** – nothing beats the thrill of peeling back digital layers.  
- **AI & ML** – exploring the line between knowing and building, one GPU task at a time.  
- **Ethical hacking & honeypots** – turning Raspberry Pis into traps and treasure maps.  
- **Gamification & personal growth** – building tools that trick people into understanding themselves.  
- **Tinkering & making** – Raspberry Pi, Arduino, networking gear, whatever I can get my hands on.

### 🧠 Currently Learning
